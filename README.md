# Introduction to Stan
This repository provides a half-day introduction to [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/).

The [lecture](presentations/introduction_to_stan.pdf) gives an introduction to [Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-wydhEuAm0) which is the core foundation of Stan's inference algorithm. It then goes on to introduce the Stan language, walking through the coding up of Stan programmes and running them (from R).

The [problem set](problem_sets/introduction_to_stan_problem_sets.pdf) gives participants experience in coding up Stan programmes and performing posterior predictive checks of models using Stan. It also gives examples of how to fit discrete-parameter models in Stan.

**Prerequisite knowledge:** programming in either R, Python or some other software which supports use of Stan. Participants should also have knowledge of the basics of Bayesian inference and how some of the simpler Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms work.
